# Draw a number
 This web app recognizes written digits. It's my first try to deploy a deep learning model :)  
 The frontend is a website with Vue.js, the backend is a Starlette server. The algorithm for digit recognition is a small ResNet trained with fast.ai.  
 Thanks to render.com for their starter app for fast.ai: https://github.com/render-examples/fastai-v3  
 Thanks to Wisdom Ekpot, I used his code as a basis for the canvas: https://github.com/Wisdom132/Simple-paint-app-with-vuejs-and-canvas-api
